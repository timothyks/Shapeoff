    <h1>Host</h1>
    <p>
        Host is a potato-like circle that is very stupid but very powerful, not knowing his true power. He is from a distant planet and to stay on that planet, you had to pass a test when you were 3 years old. Due to his stupidity, he failed the test and got exiled to the Shape-Lands.

    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Host’s first show to watch was Total Drama and that’s why he wanted to run a show so badly.

        </li>
        <li>
            He is attracted to Flabbergasted Peaks because they are very similar in greatness, but he’s too stupid to understand that.

        </li>
        <li>
            He is the only one of his kind to fail the test

        </li>
        <li>
            He hates being interrupted

        </li>
        <li>
            He has a name but can’t remember it because of his stupidity

        </li>
    </ul>
