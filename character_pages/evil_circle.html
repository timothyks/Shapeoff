    <h1>Evil Circle</h1>
    <p>
        Evil Circle, once thought to just be a manifestation of what’s evil in Circle, is the leader of the banished Shapeland Confederacy, a movement that arose 100 years ago to overthrow the corrupted government. Evil Circle is a relative to Circle (not certain if they’re brothers).

    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Nobody remembers how Evil Circle got his shades. There have been accounts of Evil Circle respawning WITH the shades. Rumor has it that the shades protect something…


        </li>
        <li>
            For some reason, Circles just think they’re better than any other shape, even though they have no sides. But they will do ANYTHING to prove anyone else wrong, which is why Evil Circle carries a knife with him.

        </li>
        <li>
            The knife that Evil Circle carries is very different from every other knife, after all, he forged it himself. No-one knows what it’s really capable of, but we’ll soon have to see…

        </li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Evil Triangle</h1>
    <p>
        Evil Triangle was rumored to spawn in the Evil World, but that has been debunked by Sphere, the leader of the government’s son (so as Evil Square). Not much is known about Evil Triangle’s origins, except that she was originally one of the first, but didn’t really do anything in the overtakings of the government. Rumor has it she escaped from the banishment of the “First” but then was banished by another dimensional group for doing some messed up things. She is very mysterious in her doings with the things she does, but maybe she’s not to blame. She was put away in a completely different dimension with no-one that liked her, her mind completely forgot on how to go back.

    <h1>Evil Square</h1>
    <p>Evil Square’s origins are a very foggy mystery, as she didn’t come from any of the “First” group. But some have rumored that perhaps a forgement related to the strong feelings and the emotions of the “First” is what has come to forge Evil Square’s existence. Nobody has any theories on how or why, but whenever you make eye contact with Evil Square you get a very strong urge to follow Evil Square, wherever she goes. Wondering is a specific trait she has developed to make other people follow her, she really likes to explore, yet no-one is sure why.
