    <h1>Octagon</h1>
    <p>
        Octagon is a hotheaded shape who had very tempered parents, hence him being so angry all the time. He expects people to never complain about him, kind of like Rhombus, but in a different way. He overreacts to a lot of things because he expects people to do better, but his temper shows that, but in a more mad way.

    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Octagon hates people with arms because he is jealous of people with arms, but little does he know, he grows them at 10. 

        </li>
        <li>
            His anger issues gets the best of him at times, so that’s why he doesn’t interact with people that shame him in any way

        </li>
        <li>
            Octagon really hates his anger issues, but he can’t control it, much like square, except much more powerful.

        </li>
        <li>
            When Octagon got eliminated in Episode 4, he never was found to go to the hospital, as he was lost in the forest, he died of ligma.

        </li>
        <li>
            In the anniversary special, Octagon grew arms, unlike Square, who is a late-bloomer.
