    <h1>Hexagon</h1>
    <p>
        Hexagon is a teenage girl that loved destruction as a child, mainly because her parents were the leaders of the most dangerous Mafia in Shape-Land. She wasn’t taken by her parents to most work because they were too busy too, but when they did, she loved it. Since she got taken to school, she has had little contact with her parents, but gradually got more dangerous along her Elementary, Middle, and Most of High School years.
