    <h1>Oval</h1>
    <p>
        Oval is a senior student who is very humble, he never had loving parents and the only person to love him was his brother, and he died because of an accident 5 years prior to the present. Since then Oval has tried to make friends, but since him being the odd one out, he has given up and has gotten depressed. He is very creative but doesn’t care about school because of his “odd-one-out” stereotype.

        <li>
            Although Oval has befriended Triangle in the past, their friendship has slowly drifted away

        </li>
        <li>
            Oval is shown to be much more caring ever since he befriended Pentagon, because he never had friendship besides his passed brother, so he treats Pentagon like a son to him, because they might be a family soon.
