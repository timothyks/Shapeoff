    <h1>Pentagon</h1>
    <p>
        Pentagon is an orphan who sees the good in anyone. He is very nice and just wants to make friends. His feelings are so strong, he has the ability to spawn rainbows. He can see when people aren’t happy and tries to cheer them up as much as he can, and this is why Oval is happy with Pentagon. He is very creative and loves to build things. But he is scared of a lot of things.

    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Even though Pentagon is very friendly, his fears crawl up like a mouse and humble him, but, it doesn’t get the best of him.

        </li>
        <li>
            Pentagon doesn’t understand anything bad, because his good shines through everything, besides the one thing bad that attacks him, his fears.
