    <h1>Square</h1>
    <p>
        Square is a young gal who is very introverted and shy, she is very small and gets picked on alot, she tries to stand up to herself, but is humbled by her feelings, she tries to explain them but all of her feelings are shadowed by sadness because the feelings are too powerful to control. She has been born with the ability to cry, but shapes can’t.

    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Square’s sister is the polar opposite of her because her parents are also polar opposites.

        </li>
        <li>
            Square doesn’t like most people because of her feelings, but deep down she tries her hardest to make friends, but her feelings are very humbling, so the only friend she has is her sister, Rectangle.

        </li>
        <li>
            Square doesn’t want to compete for Shapeoff, because she is scared her feelings will show off, and also the control of her feelings make her want to quit.

        </li>
        <li>
            Rectangle has replacement Squares everytime Square dies, because Evil Square’s emotions are so powerful, it bended reality and created extra squares
