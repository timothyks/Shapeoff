    <h1>Heptagon</h1>
    <p>
        Heptagon is a young and unintelligent boy. He comes from a run-down part of the Shape-Lands but got a good education in a prestigious private school. Although he was enrolled in a private school, he does not have the mental capacity to pass the classes, so he was forced to drop out. He now wonders the Shape-Lands, trying to search for a specific something, but no-one knows what it is, after all, he is different than most.
