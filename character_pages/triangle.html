    <h1>Triangle</h1>
    <p>
        Triangle is a teenage girl who never had anybody to love her, she had no parents, so was sent to Overhaul Orphanage, and had no friends. Ever since she was released to go to school, she has tried to put her past away and tried her hardest to make friends, but could only befriend one shape older than her, Oval, the rest are younger shapes that are unlucky as her to be in an orphanage. But when Circle crashed into the mountains and Shapeoff started, this was her true time to shine. She tried her hardest to win but failed almost all of the challenges. Triangle acts a bit neutral in Shapeoff as itâ€™s a good way to balance her competitiveness and her sadness.
