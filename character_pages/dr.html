    <h1>Dr. {}</h1>
    <p>
        Dr. {} isn’t the brightest, but very serious and smart when it comes to serious things. He graduated at 18 and enrolled in Hilly Hospital a year later, he has been working for the past 15 years and has been one of the higher class doctors and doesn’t really work with anybody else, except his partner and best friend, Heart.
