    <h1>Rectangle</h1>
    <p>
        Rectangle is a very extroverted girl who loves everyone, she is very outgoing and is always there to help, but she can be too overprotective of her sister, Square. She sees the good in everyone, and even though she is a descendant of “The First,” she does not hold as much power as her sister, like Square’s crying abilities and powerful emotions.

    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Rectangle doesn’t know what shyness is, but she tries to help Square as much as she can, because she is her only sibling.

        </li>
        <li>
            Rectangle isn’t too intelligent, but she is very helpful.

        </li>
        <li>
            Rectangle is currently in possession of approximately 8 replacement Squares in her basement. Once activated, it will be an EXACT replica of the last Square that was alive.

        </li>
        <li>
            CEO of the Square Murdr Facility, a secret lair where Rectangle just murders Square for fun.
