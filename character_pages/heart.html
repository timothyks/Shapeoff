    <h1>Heart</h1>
    <p>
        Heart is a very intelligent girl yet gullible, she graduated school at the age of 16 and started working at Hilly Hospital just 6 months later. She is the head nurse at Hilly Hospital, and has been working there for the past 17 years. She is loved by all of her co-workers and patients. Her partner and best friend, Dr. {} are very close to each other, and spend a lot of time together off work. (even though it’s a 23 hour shift.)

    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Heart trusts the corrupted CEO of Hilly Hospital, because she doesn’t know how corrupt they actually are.


        </li>
        <li>
            Heart has many showable emotions, including love-related ones.
