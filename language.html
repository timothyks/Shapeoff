    <h1>"Lapchannich": The Ancient Language of the Shapelands</h1>
    <p>
        Shapelandish is an old, rather, ancient language that inhabitants of the Shapelands once spoke. The government highly discouraged use of the language after the events of the Shapeland Confederacy 100 years ago. Since then, the language used has become American English. However, the language is still regularly spoken in the Evil World.

    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            There are two different dialects of Shapelandish, the one in the Shapelands, and the one in the Evil World. The Shapelands dialect seems to be influenced by American English in terms of vocabulary.

        </li>
        <li>
            In Shapelandish, shapes have a name that is different from their shape.

        </li>
        <li>
            There are two versions of Shapelandish, the obsolete version in early 2023, and the current one (now).

        </li>
        <li>
            TimKS stopped working on the obsolete version because he thought it sounded ugly so the new one has a lot of sounds produced at the back of the mouth, making it sound like youâ€™re deep throating something.

        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The details of the language have not been made public yet, but you're welcome to view the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Bv1Gnd14WhDUO1uONRi27LwZR73QEgqdI8UyJNoQzrM/edit?usp=sharing
