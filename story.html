    <h1>The Story of the Shapelands</h1>
    <p>
        <i>No exact dates are given, but the paragraphs are still in chronological order.</i>
    </p>
    <h2>Shaping of the Plane</h2>
    <p>
        The story starts with a... plane. The best theory is a piece of paper, 
        supported by the fact that the background is a paper-y texture in Shapeoff 1-3 and 7.
        We don't know exactly how they were brought upon this plane, but nevertheless, they were called "The First."
        These few shapes are the ancestors of every shape in the Shapelands, and beyond.
        They were sentient, they could <i>feel.</i> And when their feelings became too strong, 
        they brought upon yet another living and feeling shape. 
    </p>
    <p>
        As the population grew, so did their power. They started communicating. First with gestures, then to sounds with their 
        two-dimensional mouths. Soon, a society was formed, which is now known as the "Old Shapeland Confederacy," 
        the name given to today's shapes by the higher-ups. The name loosely translates to "shape land," in Old Shapelandish, the
        language spoken by the First and others back then, but it was commonly confused to the Shapelands, which is a more
        broader term containing all of the lands the shapes today have discovered.
    </p>
    <p>
        Soon enough, more life started to appear on the plane. It wasn't as motionful as the shapes, however. It was still,
        but not still enough to be seen as just a decoration. In our world, they're usually called trees.
        The trees became a grove, and the grove grew into a forest. The forest grew into such an anomaly that settlers in that area
        had to relocate.
    </p>
    <p>
        But the environment kept on changing. A part of the land near the forest got bumpier, and some turned into large spikes that
        soared into the sky. We call them mountains. And it was debated whether the forest or the mountains were more daunting.

    </p>
    <p>
        It was then discovered that new shapes fabricate at a certain point on the plane. The First found this out when they relocated to 
        somewhere on the other side of the forest, away from the hills and the mountains. But, when they went back to go and collect 
        the newly created shapes, they had to cross through the hills. It felt really, pleasant traversing the hills, but when they
        exited the hills, they were met with extreme sorrow and even, hopelessness. They couldn't make the trip and disintergrated
        before the new shapes were retrieved.
    </p>
    <p>
        These new shapes had no idea what to do, and no one to guide them. So, they did things their own way, and soon formed what 
        is now called "The Old Republic of Shapeland." The translation is something like "shape country," but again, it was renamed
        to distinguish it from other things.

        The story isn't over! It'll be continued soon.
