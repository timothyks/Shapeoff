    <h1>The Shapeoff Encyclopedia</h1>
    <p>
        Shapeoff has become more than just a goofy object show with minimal effort put into it. Prior to its cancellation shortly after the release of "Shapeoff 7: Hospital Heist," which is currently privated on YouTube due to personal reasons, the directors have been working for hours to expand and flesh out the lore of the Shapeoff world. <br>
        So, with that said, I've created an "encyclopedia" for the entirety of Shapeoff lore. There may be some oversights, as all of the lore was created in a single Google Docs document, but I ensure that the lore is still worth checking out.
